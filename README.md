# Reverse Engineering Study Repository

This repository contains my journey in learning reverse engineering through solving various crackme challenges. Each challenge helps me understand different aspects of binary analysis, debugging, and program behavior.


## Tools Used
- Ghidra (for static analysis)
- Strings (for text extraction)
- Basic debugging tools

## Progress
I'm continuously adding new challenges and solutions as I progress in my reverse engineering studies.
